            "A new study identifies homozygous missense mutations in SGOL1, which encodes a component of the cohesin complex, in a newly described disorder termed Chronic Atrial and Intestinal Dysrhythmia (CAID) syndrome. These findings implicate cohesin in the regulation of intrinsic cardiac and intestinal rhythm and further expand the growing group of disorders termed the cohesinopathies. Genetic mapping studies reveal that mutations in cohesion pathways are responsible for multispectrum developmental abnormalities termed cohesinopathies. These include Roberts syndrome (RBS), Cornelia de Lange Syndrome (CdLS), and Warsaw Breakage Syndrome (WABS). The cohesinopathies are characterized by overlapping phenotypes ranging from craniofacial deformities, limb defects, and mental retardation. Though these syndromes share a similar suite of phenotypes and arise due to mutations in a common cohesion pathway, the underlying mechanisms are currently believed to be distinct. Defects in mitotic failure and apoptosis i.e. trans DNA tethering events are believed to be the underlying cause of RBS, whereas the underlying cause of CdLS is largely modeled as occurring through defects in transcriptional processes i.e. cis DNA tethering events. Here, we review recent findings described primarily in zebrafish, paired with additional studies in other model systems, including human patient cells, which challenge the notion that cohesinopathies represent separate syndromes. \n",

SNP2TFBS is a computational resource intended to support researchers investigating the molecular mechanisms underlying regulatory variation in the human genome. The database essentially consists of a collection of text files providing specific annotations for human single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), namely whether they are predicted to abolish, create or change the affinity of one or several transcription factor (TF) binding sites. A SNP's effect on TF binding is estimated based on a position weight matrix (PWM) model for the binding specificity of the corresponding factor. These data files are regenerated at regular intervals by an automatic procedure that takes as input a reference genome, a comprehensive SNP catalogue and a collection of PWMs. SNP2TFBS is also accessible over a web interface, enabling users to view the information provided for an individual SNP, to extract SNPs based on various search criteria, to annotate uploaded sets of SNPs or to display statistics about the frequencies of binding sites affected by selected SNPs.

Results We present an R package phosphonormalizer for normalizing enriched samples in label-free mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics. Global centering-based normalization is a commonly used normalization approach in mass spectrometry-based label-free proteomics. It scales the peptide abundances to have the same median intensities, based on an assumption that the majority of abundances remain the same across the samples. However, especially in phosphoproteomics, this assumption can introduce bias, as the samples are enriched during sample preparation which can mask the underlying biological changes. To address this possible bias, phosphopeptides quantified in both enriched and non-enriched samples can be used to calculate factors that mitigate the bias.Results: We present an R package phosphonormalizer for normalizing enriched samples in label-free mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics.Availability and implementation: The phosphonormalizer package is freely available under GPL (â€‰>â€‰=2) license from Bioconductor (https://bioconductor.org/packages/phosphonormalizer).\n",

The trimeric SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) surface spike (S) glycoprotein consisting of three S1-S2 heterodimers binds the cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and mediates fusion of the viral and cellular membranes through a pre- to postfusion conformation transition The infection of target cells by the SARS CoV is mediated through the interaction of the viral Spike (S) protein (1255 amino acids) and its cellular receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).\n",

            " Like normal nascent chromatin, chromatin labeled for brief periods (0.5-1 min) in the presence of butyrate was more sensitive to digestion with DNase I and micrococcal nuclease than control bulk chromatin. Incubation of mature chromatin in butyrate for 1 h did not induce DNase I sensitivity: therefore, the presence of sodium butyrate was required during replication to preserve the increased digestibility of nascent chromatin DNA this class of nascent chromatin exhibits a shortened repeat length of approximately 165 bp, as opposed to the 288-bp repeat of bulk chromatin. Within 10 min of DNA synthesis, the spacing of mature chromatin is established; the spacing maturation can occur in the absence of protein synthesis. The second class of nascent DNA is distinguished from the nucleosomal component by its insolubility, lack of discernible nucleosomal organization, and dependence on protein synthesis to attain typical subunit structure In a previous study (Perry and Annunziato, Nucleic Acids Res. 17, 4275 [1989]) it was shown that when replication occurs in the presence of sodium butyrate (thereby inhibiting histone deacetylation), nascent chromatin fails to mature fully and instead remains preferentially sensitive to DNaseI, more soluble in magnesium, and depleted of histone H1 (relative to mature chromatin).

Dispersed promoters display higher associations with well-positioned nucleosomes downstream of the TSS and a more clearly defined nucleosome free region upstream, while focused promoters have a less organized nucleosome structure, yet higher presence of RNA polymerase II. Nucleosome depletion at 5'-HS4 was dependent on interaction of the insulator protein CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) and was required for enhancer blocking.  hese differences extend to histone variants (H2A.Z) and marks (H3K4 methylation), as well as insulator binding (such as CTCF), independent of the expression levels of affected genes.

In aggregate, our data indicate that domains typically involved in regulation of gene expression do not serve that role in PRDM9, but are likely involved in setting the proper chromatin environment for initiation and completion of homologous recombination. In many eukaryotes, sites of meiotic recombination, also called hotspots, are regions of accessible chromatin, but in many vertebrates, their location follows a distinct pattern and is specified by PR domain-containing protein 9 (PRDM9).  PRDM9 (PR domain-containing protein 9) is a meiosis-specific protein that trimethylates H3K4 and controls the activation of recombination hot spots. It is an essential enzyme in the progression of early meiotic prophase. Our findings do not identify the nature of the underlying DNA sequences, but argue against the proposed role of Prdm9 as an essential transcription factor in mouse meiosis PRDM9 Methyltransferase Activity Is Essential for Meiotic DNA Double-Strand Break Formation at Its Binding Sites.\n",

Rs17518584 is located about 170 kb upstream of the transcription start site of the major transcript for the CADM2 gene, but is within an intron of a variant transcript that includes an alternative first exon. The variant is associated with expression of CADM2 in the cingulate cortex (P-value=4 Ã— 10(-4)). The protein encoded by CADM2 is involved in glutamate signaling (P-value=7.22 Ã— 10(-15)), gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transport (P-value=1.36 Ã— 10(-11)) and neuron cell-cell adhesion (P-value=1.48 Ã— 10(-13)).

            "The exponential reduction in cost of genome sequencing has resulted in a rapid growth of genomic data. Most of the entropy of short read data lies not in the sequence of read bases themselves but in their Quality Scores-the confidence measurement that each base has been sequenced correctly. Lossless compression methods are now close to their theoretical limits and hence there is a need for lossy methods that further reduce the complexity of these data without impacting downstream analyses.RESULTS: We here propose GeneCodeq, a Bayesian method inspired by coding theory for adjusting quality scores to improve the compressibility of quality scores without adversely impacting genotyping accuracy. Our model leverages a corpus of k-mers to reduce the entropy of the quality scores and thereby the compressibility of these data (in FASTQ or SAM/BAM/CRAM files), resulting in compression ratios that significantly exceeds those of other methods. Our approach can also be combined with existing lossy compression schemes to further reduce entropy and allows the user to specify a reference panel of expected sequence variations to improve the model accuracy. In addition to extensive empirical evaluation, we also derive novel theoretical insights that explain the empirical performance and pitfalls of corpus-based quality score compression schemes in general. Finally, we show that as a positive side effect of compression, the model can lead to improved genotyping accuracy.AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: GeneCodeq is available at: github.com/genecodeq/eval GeneCodeq: quality score compression and improved genotyping using a Bayesian framework.

Quality-of-life scores did not differ between the treatment groups.  Patients on minocycline also had non-significant tendencies towards faster decline in FVC (-3.48 vs -3.01, -1.03 to 0.11; p=0.11) and MMT score (-0.30 vs -0.26, -0.08 to 0.01; p=0.11), and greater mortality during the 9-month treatment phase (hazard ratio=1.32, 95% CI 0.83 to 2.10; p=0.23) than did patients on placebo. This pilot study shows that minocycline and riluzole can be taken safely together. Further trials are needed to assess efficacy of such treatment. A recent publication of the results of a clinical trial of minocycline in 412 ALS patient has aroused considerable controversy in the ALS scientific community.

EVs can cross the physiological barriers, and a variety of biological fluids are enriched in them. EVs are a heterogeneous population of vesicles, including exosomes, microvesicles, and apoptotic bodies.  Extracellular vesicles are cell-derived membrane particles ranging from 30 to 5,000Â nm in size, including exosomes, microvesicles, and apoptotic bodies. They are released under physiological conditions, but also upon cellular activation, senescence, and apoptosis. They play an important role in intercellular communication.  Extracellular vesicles (EVs), microparticles, exosomes, and apoptotic bodies, originated by different cell types are emerging as a novel mean of cell-to-cell communication in physiology and pathology and represent a new way to convey fundamental information between cells.

            "In vitro, the three known yeast nucleosome spacing enzymes (CHD1, ISW1 and ISW2) form arrays with different spacing. Isw1b acts in conjunction with Chd1 to regulate chromatin structure by preventing trans-histone exchange from taking place over coding regions. In this way, Isw1b and Chd1 are important in maintaining chromatin integrity during transcription elongation by RNAPII. We propose that CHD1 directs short spacing, resulting in eviction of H1 and chromatin unfolding, whereas ISW1 directs longer spacing, allowing H1 to bind and condense the chromatin CHD1 and ISW1 compete to set the spacing on most genes, such that CHD1 dominates genes with shorter spacing and ISW1 dominates genes with longer spacing The ISW1 and CHD1 ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers compete to set nucleosome spacing in vivo\n",

Breast cancer ( BC ) is the most common type of malignancy in female patients and radio-treatment is the conventional therapy even if a great number of studies reported that enhanced sensitivity to ionizing radiation as measured as chromosome effects is present in a significant proportion of cancer patients , including breast cancer ones .  Ionizing radiation exposure is a risk factor for development of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma , a histological subtype of esophageal cancer that is highly aggressive and is associated with poor patient prognosis . \n",

Our results propose that KAT2A inhibition should be investigated as a therapeutic strategy in AML and provide a large number of genetic vulnerabilities of this leukemia that can be pursued in downstream studies. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an aggressive cancer with a poor prognosis, for which mainstream treatments have not changed for decades. To identify additional therapeutic targets in AML, we optimize a genome-wide clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) screening platform and use it to identify genetic vulnerabilities in AML cells. We identify 492 AML-specific cell-essential genes, including several established therapeutic targets such as DOT1L, BCL2, and MEN1, and many other genes including clinically actionable candidates. We validate selected genes using genetic and pharmacological inhibition, and chose KAT2A as a candidate for downstream study.

            "Emerging lines of evidence indicate that histone variants (H2AX and H2A.Z), histone post-translational modifications (acetylation, phosphorylation, methylation and ubiquitination) and chromatin-remodeling complexes (INO80, SWR1, SWI/SNF, RSC and NuRD) are important and direct players in the DNA double-strand break (DSB) response as well. In contrast, H2A.Z deposition is dispensable for nucleosome positioning.  Accordingly, the absence of SWR-C or histone H2A.Z results in compromised chromatin remodeling and impaired gene expression in the absence of RSC and H3K4 methylation. In RSC-depleted cells, NFRs shrink such that the average positions of flanking nucleosomes move toward predicted sites. In contrast, the upstream nucleosome which covers the TATA box under repressed conditions is shifted approximately 50 bp further upstream by the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler RSC upon activation. It is marked with the histone variant H2A.Z and H4K16 acetylation in active state\n",

The identification and characterization of signal pleckstrin homology (PH)-domain-binding motifs established critical sites for breast cancer growth in PAR1&2. The identification and characterization of signal pleckstrin homology (PH)-domain-binding motifs established critical sites for breast cancer growth in PAR1&2. Although emerging roles of protease-activated receptor1&2 (PAR1&2) in cancer are recognized, their underlying signalling events are poorly understood. Here we show signal-binding motifs in PAR1&2 that are critical for breast cancer growth. This occurs via the association of the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain with Akt/PKB as a key signalling event of PARs. Other PH-domain signal-proteins such as Etk/Bmx and Vav3 also associate with PAR1 and PAR2 through their PH domains. PAR1 and PAR2 bind with priority to Etk/Bmx. A point mutation in PAR2, H349A, but not in R352A, abrogates PH-protein association and is sufficient to markedly reduce PAR2-instigated breast tumour growth in vivo and placental extravillous trophoblast (EVT) invasion in vitro. Similarly, the PAR1 mutant hPar1-7A, which is unable to bind the PH domain, reduces mammary tumours and EVT invasion, endowing these motifs with physiological significance and underscoring the importance of these previously unknown PAR1 and PAR2 PH-domain-binding motifs in both pathological and physiological invasion processes.\n",

Three patients had serious adverse events: two in the eculizumab group (anaphylaxis in one patient and intracranial haemorrhage and abscess in another patient) and one in the placebo group (depression).

Under these circumstances, the classical Cochran-Armitage trend test (CATT) is suboptimal. Robust procedures that maximize the power and preserve the nominal type I error rate are preferable. Moreover, performing a meta-analysis using robust procedures is of great interest and has never been addressed in the past. The primary goal of this work is to implement several robust methods for analysis and meta-analysis in the statistical package Stata and subsequently to make the software available to the scientific community.Results: The CATT under a recessive, additive and dominant model of inheritance as well as robust methods based on the Maximum Efficiency Robust Test statistic, the MAX statistic and the MIN2 were implemented in Stata. Concerning MAX and MIN2, we calculated their asymptotic null distributions relying on numerical integration resulting in a great gain in computational time without losing accuracy. All the aforementioned approaches were employed in a fixed or a random effects meta-analysis setting using summary data with weights equal to the reciprocal of the combined cases and controls. Overall, this is the first complete effort to implement procedures for analysis and meta-analysis in GWAS using Stata.Availability and Implementation: A Stata program and a web-server are freely available for academic users at http://www.compgen.org/tools/GWAR.

            "Animal promoters initiate transcription either at precise positions (narrow promoters) or dispersed regions (broad promoters), a distinction referred to as promoter shape. Although highly conserved, the functional properties of promoters with different shapes and the genetic basis of their evolution remain unclear. Here we used natural genetic variation across a panel of 81 Drosophila lines to measure changes in transcriptional start site (TSS) usage, identifying thousands of genetic variants affecting transcript levels (strength) or the distribution of TSSs within a promoter (shape). Our results identify promoter shape as a molecular trait that can evolve independently of promoter strength. Broad promoters typically harbor shape-associated variants, with signatures of adaptive selection. Single-cell measurements demonstrate that variants modulating promoter shape often increase expression noise, whereas heteroallelic interactions with other promoter variants alleviate these effects. These results uncover new functional properties of natural promoters and suggest the minimization of expression noise as an important factor in promoter evolution. Promoter shape varies across populations and affects promoter evolution and expression noise. Promoter shape varies across populations and affects promoter evolution and expression noise\n",

While in recent years much progress has been made in the development of tools for gene targeting, little attention has been given to the identification of sites in the human genome where transgenes can be inserted and reliably expressed. In order to find human genomic sites capable of supporting long-term and high-level transgene expression in hPSCs, we performed a lentiviral screen in human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). We isolated 40 iPSC clones each harboring a single vector copy and characterized the level of transgene expression afforded by each unique integration site. We selected one clone, LiPS-A3 with an integration site in chromosome 15 maintaining robust expression without silencing and demonstrate that different transgenes can be inserted therein rapidly and efficiently through recombinase-mediated cassette exchange (RMCE). The LiPS-A3 line can greatly facilitate the insertion of reporter and other genes in hPSCs. Targeting transgenes in the LiPS-A3S genomic locus can find broad applications in stem cell research and possibly cell and gene therapy.

            "XenofilteR: computational deconvolution of mouse and human reads in tumor xenograft sequence data. Mouse xenografts from (patient-derived) tumors (PDX) or tumor cell lines are widely used as models to study various biological and preclinical aspects of cancer. However, analyses of their RNA and DNA profiles are challenging, because they comprise reads not only from the grafted human cancer but also from the murine host. The reads of murine origin result in false positives in mutation analysis of DNA samples and obscure gene expression levels when sequencing RNA. However, currently available algorithms are limited and improvements in accuracy and ease of use are necessary.RESULTS: We developed the R-package XenofilteR, which separates mouse from human sequence reads based on the edit-distance between a sequence read and reference genome. To assess the accuracy of XenofilteR, we generated sequence data by in silico mixing of mouse and human DNA sequence data. These analyses revealed that XenofilteR removes >â€‰99.9% of sequence reads of mouse origin while retaining human sequences. This allowed for mutation analysis of xenograft samples with accurate variant allele frequencies, and retrieved all non-synonymous somatic tumor mutations.CONCLUSIONS: XenofilteR accurately dissects RNA and DNA sequences from mouse and human origin, thereby outperforming currently available tools. XenofilteR is open source and available at https://github.com/PeeperLab/XenofilteR . We developed the R-package XenofilteR, which separates mouse from human sequence reads based on the edit-distance between a sequence read and reference genome.

The easyGWAS tool supports multiple species, the uploading of private genotype data and summary statistics of existing GWAS, as well as advanced methods for comparing GWAS results across different experiments and data sets in an interactive and user-friendly interface. The ever-growing availability of high-quality genotypes for a multitude of species has enabled researchers to explore the underlying genetic architecture of complex phenotypes at an unprecedented level of detail using genome-wide association studies (GWAS). The systematic comparison of results obtained from GWAS of different traits opens up new possibilities, including the analysis of pleiotropic effects. Other advantages that result from the integration of multiple GWAS are the ability to replicate GWAS signals and to increase statistical power to detect such signals through meta-analyses. In order to facilitate the simple comparison of GWAS results, we present easyGWAS, a powerful, species-independent online resource for computing, storing, sharing, annotating, and comparing GWAS. The easyGWAS tool supports multiple species, the uploading of private genotype data and summary statistics of existing GWAS, as well as advanced methods for comparing GWAS results across different experiments and data sets in an interactive and user-friendly interface. easyGWAS is also a public data repository for GWAS data and summary statistics and already includes published data and results from several major GWAS.

            "These results strongly suggest that recombination is the primary determinant of the isochore organization of mammalian genomes. Thus, chromosomal position can directly affect the rate of evolution of a gene. Such an accelerated rate of evolution might be due to factors other than natural selection, in particular GC-biased gene conversion. This is true of neutral sequences, but also of constrained sequences, which can be illustrated using the mouse Fxy gen We have previously described a gene, Fxy , that spans the pseudoautosomal boundary in mice such that the first three exons of the gene are located on the X chromosome, but the remainder of the gene is located on both X and Y chromosomes. Therefore, this gene might be in a state of transition between pseudoautosomal and X-unique locations.  The mouse Fxy gene was translocated into the highly recombining pseudoautosomal region comparatively recently in evolutionary terms. This event resulted in a rapid increase of GC content.\n",

The four genes within PAR2 have been proposed to constitute two zones with different base ratios and transcription, one of which was added recently to the X chromosome. In contrast, so far only 4 genes have been discovered in the PAR2 region. The pseudoautosomal regions (PAR1 and PAR2) of the human X and Y chromosomes pair and recombine during meiosis. Thus genes in this region are not inherited in a strictly sex-linked fashion. PAR1 is located at the terminal region of the short arms and PAR2 at the tips of the long arms of these chromosomes. To date, 24 genes have been assigned to the PAR1 region. The human sex chromosomes differ in sequence, except for the pseudoautosomal regions (PAR) at the terminus of the short and the long arms, denoted as PAR1 and PAR2. The boundary between PAR1 and the unique X and Y sequences was established during the divergence of the great apes. \n",

CaMK4 inhibition has potential as a therapeutic strategy for Th17-driven autoimmune diseases. CaMK4-dependent activation of AKT/mTOR and CREM-Î± underlies autoimmunity-associated Th17 imbalance CaMK4 inhibition significantly decreased the levels of glycolytic intermediates such as glucose-6-phosphate, fructose-6-phosphate, fructose-1,6-diphosphate, pyruvate, and lactate, whereas it did not affect the levels of the pentose phosphate pathway intermediates such as 6-Phospho-D-gluconate, ribulose-5-phosphate, ribose-5-phosphate and phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate Inhibition of CaMK4 reduced Il17 transcription through decreased activation of the cAMP response element modulator Î± (CREM-Î±) and reduced activation of the AKT/mTOR pathway, which is known to enhance Th17 differentiation.', 'A new study identifies homozygous missense mutations in SGOL1, which encodes a component of the cohesin complex, in a newly described disorder termed Chronic Atrial and Intestinal Dysrhythmia (CAID) syndrome. These findings implicate cohesin in the regulation of intrinsic cardiac and intestinal rhythm and further expand the growing group of disorders termed the cohesinopathies. Genetic mapping studies reveal that mutations in cohesion pathways are responsible for multispectrum developmental abnormalities termed cohesinopathies. These include Roberts syndrome (RBS), Cornelia de Lange Syndrome (CdLS), and Warsaw Breakage Syndrome (WABS). The cohesinopathies are characterized by overlapping phenotypes ranging from craniofacial deformities, limb defects, and mental retardation. Though these syndromes share a similar suite of phenotypes and arise due to mutations in a common cohesion pathway, the underlying mechanisms are currently believed to be distinct. Defects in mitotic failure and apoptosis i.e. trans DNA tethering events are believed to be the underlying cause of RBS, whereas the underlying cause of CdLS is largely modeled as occurring through defects in transcriptional processes i.e. cis DNA tethering events. Here, we review recent findings described primarily in zebrafish, paired with additional studies in other model systems, including human patient cells, which challenge the notion that cohesinopathies represent separate syndromes.

Incubation of mature chromatin in butyrate for 1 h did not induce DNase I sensitivity: therefore, the presence of sodium butyrate was required during replication to preserve the increased digestibility of nascent chromatin DNA this class of nascent chromatin exhibits a shortened repeat length of approximately 165 bp, as opposed to the 288-bp repeat of bulk chromatin. Within 10 min of DNA synthesis, the spacing of mature chromatin is established; the spacing maturation can occur in the absence of protein synthesis. The second class of nascent DNA is distinguished from the nucleosomal component by its insolubility, lack of discernible nucleosomal organization, and dependence on protein synthesis to attain typical subunit structure In a previous study (Perry and Annunziato, Nucleic Acids Res. 17, 4275 [1989]) it was shown that when replication occurs in the presence of sodium butyrate (thereby inhibiting histone deacetylation), nascent chromatin fails to mature fully and instead remains preferentially sensitive to DNaseI, more soluble in magnesium, and depleted of histone H1 (relative to mature chromatin).

Most of the entropy of short read data lies not in the sequence of read bases themselves but in their Quality Scores-the confidence measurement that each base has been sequenced correctly. Lossless compression methods are now close to their theoretical limits and hence there is a need for lossy methods that further reduce the complexity of these data without impacting downstream analyses.RESULTS: We here propose GeneCodeq, a Bayesian method inspired by coding theory for adjusting quality scores to improve the compressibility of quality scores without adversely impacting genotyping accuracy. Our model leverages a corpus of k-mers to reduce the entropy of the quality scores and thereby the compressibility of these data (in FASTQ or SAM/BAM/CRAM files), resulting in compression ratios that significantly exceeds those of other methods. Our approach can also be combined with existing lossy compression schemes to further reduce entropy and allows the user to specify a reference panel of expected sequence variations to improve the model accuracy.

We propose that CHD1 directs short spacing, resulting in eviction of H1 and chromatin unfolding, whereas ISW1 directs longer spacing, allowing H1 to bind and condense the chromatin CHD1 and ISW1 compete to set the spacing on most genes, such that CHD1 dominates genes with shorter spacing and ISW1 dominates genes with longer spacing The ISW1 and CHD1 ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers compete to set nucleosome spacing in vivo', 'Gamma-ray irradiation introduces single and/or double strand breaks into the DNA molecule of the cells. RESULTS BRCA2-defective cells were unable to repair the double-strand DNA breaks induced by ionizing radiation. Ionizing radiation and radiomimetic drugs such as bleomycin, calichieamycin, neocarzinostatin chromophore, and other synthetic agents can produce both single and double strand breaks in DNA. BACKGROUND Induction of DNA double strand breaks and alterations in the repair of these breaks is implicated in breast carcinogenesis. The induction of DNA interstrand cross-links by ionizing radiation has been largely ignored in favour of studies on double-strand break formation and repair.', ' This study provides strong evidence of positive associations between protracted low-dose radiation exposure and leukaemia.FU e highest risk of radiation- induced breast cancer is evidenced in the sub-population of female patients who have undergone radiotherapy for either malignant or non-malignant diseases Because latency period for different nosological forms of radiation-induced malignant tumors varies widely, profound attention in further studies should be drawn not only to thyroid, breast cancers and leukemia, but also to malignancies with longer latent period: lung, stomach, colon, ovary, urinary bladder, kidney cancer and multiple myeloma. Breast cancer ( BC ) is the most common type of malignancy in female patients and radio-treatment is the conventional therapy even if a great number of studies reported that enhanced sensitivity to ionizing radiation as measured as chromosome effects is present in a significant proportion of cancer patients , including breast cancer ones .  Ionizing radiation exposure is a risk factor for development of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma , a histological subtype of esophageal cancer that is highly aggressive and is associated with poor patient prognosis .

Our results propose that KAT2A inhibition should be investigated as a therapeutic strategy in AML and provide a large number of genetic vulnerabilities of this leukemia that can be pursued in downstream studies. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an aggressive cancer with a poor prognosis, for which mainstream treatments have not changed for decades. To identify additional therapeutic targets in AML, we optimize a genome-wide clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) screening platform and use it to identify genetic vulnerabilities in AML cells. We identify 492 AML-specific cell-essential genes, including several established therapeutic targets such as DOT1L, BCL2, and MEN1, and many other genes including clinically actionable candidates. We validate selected genes using genetic and pharmacological inhibition, and chose KAT2A as a candidate for downstream study.

In contrast, H2A.Z deposition is dispensable for nucleosome positioning.  Accordingly, the absence of SWR-C or histone H2A.Z results in compromised chromatin remodeling and impaired gene expression in the absence of RSC and H3K4 methylation. In RSC-depleted cells, NFRs shrink such that the average positions of flanking nucleosomes move toward predicted sites. In contrast, the upstream nucleosome which covers the TATA box under repressed conditions is shifted approximately 50 bp further upstream by the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler RSC upon activation.

The identification and characterization of signal pleckstrin homology (PH)-domain-binding motifs established critical sites for breast cancer growth in PAR1&2. Although emerging roles of protease-activated receptor1&2 (PAR1&2) in cancer are recognized, their underlying signalling events are poorly understood. Here we show signal-binding motifs in PAR1&2 that are critical for breast cancer growth. This occurs via the association of the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain with Akt/PKB as a key signalling event of PARs. Other PH-domain signal-proteins such as Etk/Bmx and Vav3 also associate with PAR1 and PAR2 through their PH domains. PAR1 and PAR2 bind with priority to Etk/Bmx. A point mutation in PAR2, H349A, but not in R352A, abrogates PH-protein association and is sufficient to markedly reduce PAR2-instigated breast tumour growth in vivo and placental extravillous trophoblast (EVT) invasion in vitro. Similarly, the PAR1 mutant hPar1-7A, which is unable to bind the PH domain, reduces mammary tumours and EVT invasion, endowing these motifs with physiological significance and underscoring the importance of these previously unknown PAR1 and PAR2 PH-domain-binding motifs in both pathological and physiological invasion processes.', 'Delays in vaccination can stymie the development of herd immunity, and a large proportion of children in the U.S. are known not to receive vaccines on time.

Although highly conserved, the functional properties of promoters with different shapes and the genetic basis of their evolution remain unclear. Here we used natural genetic variation across a panel of 81 Drosophila lines to measure changes in transcriptional start site (TSS) usage, identifying thousands of genetic variants affecting transcript levels (strength) or the distribution of TSSs within a promoter (shape). Our results identify promoter shape as a molecular trait that can evolve independently of promoter strength. Broad promoters typically harbor shape-associated variants, with signatures of adaptive selection. Single-cell measurements demonstrate that variants modulating promoter shape often increase expression noise, whereas heteroallelic interactions with other promoter variants alleviate these effects. These results uncover new functional properties of natural promoters and suggest the minimization of expression noise as an important factor in promoter evolution.

Mouse xenografts from (patient-derived) tumors (PDX) or tumor cell lines are widely used as models to study various biological and preclinical aspects of cancer. However, analyses of their RNA and DNA profiles are challenging, because they comprise reads not only from the grafted human cancer but also from the murine host. The reads of murine origin result in false positives in mutation analysis of DNA samples and obscure gene expression levels when sequencing RNA. However, currently available algorithms are limited and improvements in accuracy and ease of use are necessary.RESULTS: We developed the R-package XenofilteR, which separates mouse from human sequence reads based on the edit-distance between a sequence read and reference genome. To assess the accuracy of XenofilteR, we generated sequence data by in silico mixing of mouse and human DNA sequence data. These analyses revealed that XenofilteR removes >\\u200999.9% of sequence reads of mouse origin while retaining human sequences. This allowed for mutation analysis of xenograft samples with accurate variant allele frequencies, and retrieved all non-synonymous somatic tumor mutations.CONCLUSIONS: XenofilteR accurately dissects RNA and DNA sequences from mouse and human origin, thereby outperforming currently available tools.

The easyGWAS tool supports multiple species, the uploading of private genotype data and summary statistics of existing GWAS, as well as advanced methods for comparing GWAS results across different experiments and data sets in an interactive and user-friendly interface. The ever-growing availability of high-quality genotypes for a multitude of species has enabled researchers to explore the underlying genetic architecture of complex phenotypes at an unprecedented level of detail using genome-wide association studies (GWAS). The systematic comparison of results obtained from GWAS of different traits opens up new possibilities, including the analysis of pleiotropic effects. Other advantages that result from the integration of multiple GWAS are the ability to replicate GWAS signals and to increase statistical power to detect such signals through meta-analyses.

Thus, chromosomal position can directly affect the rate of evolution of a gene. Such an accelerated rate of evolution might be due to factors other than natural selection, in particular GC-biased gene conversion. This is true of neutral sequences, but also of constrained sequences, which can be illustrated using the mouse Fxy gen We have previously described a gene, Fxy , that spans the pseudoautosomal boundary in mice such that the first three exons of the gene are located on the X chromosome, but the remainder of the gene is located on both X and Y chromosomes. Therefore, this gene might be in a state of transition between pseudoautosomal and X-unique locations.  The mouse Fxy gene was translocated into the highly recombining pseudoautosomal region comparatively recently in evolutionary terms. This event resulted in a rapid increase of GC content.', 'The insertion is generated by non-allelic homologous recombination between a 548 bp LTR6B repeat within the Y chromosome PAR1 and a second LTR6B repeat located 105 kb from the PAR boundary on the X chromosome.   The four genes within PAR2 have been proposed to constitute two zones with different base ratios and transcription, one of which was added recently to the X chromosome. In contrast, so far only 4 genes have been discovered in the PAR2 region. The pseudoautosomal regions (PAR1 and PAR2) of the human X and Y chromosomes pair and recombine during meiosis. Thus genes in this region are not inherited in a strictly sex-linked fashion. PAR1 is located at the terminal region of the short arms and PAR2 at the tips of the long arms of these chromosomes. To date, 24 genes have been assigned to the PAR1 region. The human sex chromosomes differ in sequence, except for the pseudoautosomal regions (PAR) at the terminus of the short and the long arms, denoted as PAR1 and PAR2. The boundary between PAR1 and the unique X and Y sequences was established during the divergence of the great apes. ']\n"
